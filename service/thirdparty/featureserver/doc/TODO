 * OGR datasource doesn't support MultiGeoms
 * KML Format (vectorformats) does not support multigeoms
 * GeoRSS Format doesn't adequately bail when given multigeoms (maybe)
 * Need support for processing-actions -- reading from config, applying to
   datasources
   * Once an action is on a Datasource, needs to be called in Server.py
   * Once processing-actions work, need support for reading processing-info
     from URL params
     
 * Improved querying: 
   * Update parsing in Service.Request to parse more action types 
   * Update backends to support more action types.

 * Needs testing on mod_python, CGI
